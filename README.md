# Abstract External Node:

This repository provides resources for deploying and managing nodes on the Abstract network. It includes configurations and scripts to facilitate the setup of both external nodes and associated services. 
The repository is structured to support the deployment of nodes using Docker and Docker Compose, simplifying the process of running an Abstract network node locally or on a server. 
Additionally, it offers configurations for monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, enabling users to observe node performance and network metrics effectively.

You can also deploy a preconfigured node directly on Railway:
